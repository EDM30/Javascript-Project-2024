What did i learn in this small project
-  The game simulates spinning reels, calculates winnings based on matching symbols, and allows players to continue playing until they run out of money or choose to stop
- Through the code i was able to learn how to implement simple game logic and simple handling inputs and by managing a basic gambling game using imple javascript.

This code implements a slot machine game that follows these steps:
//1. Deposit some money
The deposit() function prompts the user to enter a valid deposit amount, ensuring it's a positive number.
//2. Determine number of lines to bet on
getNumberOfLines() asks the user to choose how many lines they want to bet on (1-3).
//3. Collect a bet amount
getBet() function collects the bet amount per line, making sure it's within the user's balance.
//4. Spin the slot machine
The spin() function simulates the slot machine, generating random symbols for each reel.
//5. Check if the user won
getWinnings() checks the rows for matching symbols to determine if the user won.
//6. Give the user their winnings
The game calculates and adds winnings to the user's balance, displaying the amount won.
//7. Play again
The game loops, allowing the user to play again until they run out of money or choose to stop.
